    <div class="intro">
        <p>In 2042, the climate crisis has reached critical levels. Amidst this backdrop, Adam Powers—scientist, podcast host, and environmental advocate—races against time to launch Green Horizon, a revolutionary green technology nonprofit that could transform humanity's relationship with energy.</p>
        <p>But powerful corporate interests have been systematically suppressing clean energy innovations for decades. As Adam builds his PodcastEmpire and prepares for a crucial crowdfunding campaign, he finds himself drawn into a dangerous game of corporate espionage, technological resistance, and global-scale conspiracy.</p>
        <p>With just 30 days until his May 9th launch event, Adam must navigate the gamified business landscape, build his team, grow his audience, and protect the breakthrough technology that could change everything—if he can stay alive long enough to share it with the world.</p>
