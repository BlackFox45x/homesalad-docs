# Image Placeholders

This directory would contain the following images for the HomeSalad documentation:

1. `hero-bg.jpg` - Hero background image for the main page
2. `logo.png` - HomeSalad logo
3. `environmental-states/` - Directory containing images showing the three environmental states:
   - `degraded.jpg` - Showing a degraded environment
   - `transitional.jpg` - Showing an environment in transition
   - `restored.jpg` - Showing a fully restored environment
4. `character-portraits/` - Directory containing character portraits for major NPCs
5. `location-images/` - Directory containing images of the five districts
6. `ui-mockups/` - Directory containing UI mockups for the game
7. `system-diagrams/` - Directory containing technical diagrams for the systems

In a complete implementation, these would be actual image files rather than placeholders.
