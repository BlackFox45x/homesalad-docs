                <h1>World Overview</h1>
                
                <h2>Setting: Greenville</h2>
                
                <p>Greenville is a mid-sized town located in a fertile valley surrounded by diverse landscapes including forests, rivers, and agricultural land. Once a thriving community known for both its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, Greenville now stands at a crossroads between continued decline and potential revitalization.</p>
                
                <h3>History</h3>
                
                <p>Greenville was founded in the late 19th century as an agricultural settlement, taking advantage of the rich soil and favorable climate of the valley. In the mid-20th century, the town experienced significant growth when several manufacturing facilities were established, producing agricultural equipment, textiles, and later, electronics.</p>
                
                <p>For decades, Greenville maintained a balanced economy between agriculture and manufacturing, with many families involved in both sectors. Local farms supplied food to the region while factories provided stable employment and attracted workers from surrounding areas.</p>
                
                <p>The decline began approximately 20 years ago when globalization and automation led to the closure of most manufacturing facilities. Without these economic anchors, Greenville experienced population loss, decreased tax revenue, and deteriorating infrastructure. Agricultural practices intensified to compensate, leading to soil degradation, water contamination, and loss of biodiversity.</p>
                
                <p>In response to these challenges, a group of forward-thinking residents formed the Green Spark movement ten years ago, focusing on sustainable agriculture, community resilience, and economic alternatives. Led by Elena Thorne, a former corporate executive who returned to her hometown with new perspectives, the movement gained initial momentum but fragmented after Elena's mysterious disappearance five years ago.</p>
                
                <h3>Geography</h3>
                
                <p>Greenville is divided into five distinct districts, each with unique characteristics and environmental challenges:</p>
                
                <div class="card-grid">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Rust Belt District</h4>
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Industrial contamination, abandoned infrastructure</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential:</strong> Maker spaces, urban agriculture, renewable energy production</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Downtown Commons</h4>
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Economic decline, lack of community spaces</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential:</strong> Community hub, local business revival, cultural center</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Riverside Heights</h4>
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Water management, flooding, resistance to change</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential:</strong> Water conservation showcase, heritage preservation</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Meadowbrook Suburbs</h4>
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Lawn culture, utility costs, social isolation</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential:</strong> Neighborhood food production, energy efficiency</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Brightwater Shores</h4>
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Development pressure, water access, ecosystem preservation</p>
                        <p><strong>Potential:</strong> Renewable energy, watershed protection, ecotourism</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>These districts are interconnected by the Greenville River, which flows from the highlands through Riverside Heights, past Downtown Commons, through the Rust Belt District, and finally into Brightwater Lake. The river's health serves as a metaphor and practical indicator for the community's overall wellbeing.</p>
                
                <h3>Current Crisis</h3>
                
                <p>As the game begins, Greenville faces multiple interconnected crises:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economic Hardship:</strong> High unemployment, declining property values, and limited economic opportunities have created financial stress for many residents. Young people continue to leave for opportunities elsewhere, creating a demographic imbalance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Degradation:</strong> Years of industrial pollution, intensive agriculture, and neglect have damaged local ecosystems. Soil contamination, water pollution, and biodiversity loss affect both natural systems and human health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate Takeover Threat:</strong> MegaGrow Industries (a subsidiary of GlobalCore Technologies) has announced plans for a "Greenville Renewal Initiative" that would redevelop large portions of the town according to their centralized, technology-driven vision. Their plan promises jobs and economic growth but threatens community autonomy and environmental health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Fragmentation:</strong> The community has become divided between those who support MegaGrow's development plans, those who resist any change, and those seeking alternative paths forward. The Green Spark Collective, once a unifying force, has splintered into smaller groups with different priorities.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The player arrives in this context, with the skills and perspective to potentially bridge divides and catalyze positive transformation.</p>
                
                <h3>Visual Evolution</h3>
                
                <p>A key aspect of HomeSalad's world is its visual transformation as players restore environmental health and build community resilience. Each area can progress through multiple states of restoration:</p>

                <h2>Themes</h2>
                
                <p>HomeSalad explores several interconnected themes through its narrative and gameplay:</p>
                
                <h3>Environmental Action</h3>
                
                <p>The game explores the tension between immediate needs and long-term sustainability. Rather than positioning environmental concerns as a luxury or distant priority, HomeSalad demonstrates how ecological health is fundamental to community wellbeing. Players learn practical approaches to environmental restoration that work with natural systems rather than against them.</p>
                
                <p>Key aspects include:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Community Building</h3>
                
                <p>HomeSalad emphasizes that resilient communities require intentional cultivation of social structures and relationships. The game shows how community connections provide support during challenges, enable resource sharing, and create the foundation for collective action.</p>
                
                <p>Key aspects include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Building trust across different groups and perspectives</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Knowledge Transfer</h3>
                
                <p>The preservation and sharing of knowledge—both traditional and innovative—is central to HomeSalad's themes. The game values diverse ways of knowing and shows how combining traditional wisdom with new approaches creates resilient solutions.</p>
                
                <p>Key aspects include:</p>

                    <li>Recognizing the value of experiential and embodied knowledge</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Resource Management</h3>
                
                <p>HomeSalad demonstrates principles of strategic resource use, showing how limited materials, energy, time, and social capital can be allocated for maximum positive impact. The game illustrates circular economy concepts where "waste" becomes a resource.</p>
                
                <p>Key aspects include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying leverage points for system change</li>
                    <li>Creating closed-loop systems that minimize waste</li>
                    <li>Prioritizing interventions based on needs and potential impact</li>
                    <li>Developing abundance through diversity and interconnection</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Corporate Resistance</h3>
                
                <p>The conflict with MegaGrow Industries explores alternatives to exploitative economic models. Rather than portraying all business as negative, HomeSalad contrasts extractive corporate approaches with regenerative local enterprises.</p>
                
                <p>Key aspects include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Questioning assumptions about "progress" and "development"</li>
                    <li>Creating alternative economic models based on community needs</li>
                    <li>Navigating power imbalances between local communities and corporations</li>
                    <li>Developing strategies for effective resistance and alternative-building</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Tone and Atmosphere</h2>
                
                <h3>Hopeful Realism</h3>
                
                <p>HomeSalad strikes a balance between acknowledging real challenges and emphasizing the possibility of positive change. The game avoids both naive optimism that ignores structural problems and paralyzing despair that prevents action. Instead, it presents a grounded hope based on practical solutions and collective effort.</p>
                
                <p>The narrative recognizes that transformation is neither quick nor easy, requiring persistent work and navigating setbacks. However, it shows that meaningful progress is possible through strategic action and community building.</p>
                
                <h3>Visual Contrast</h3>
                
                <p>The visual design emphasizes the contrast between industrial decay and natural beauty, often showing them in juxtaposition. Abandoned factories with plants growing through cracks, community gardens beside vacant lots, and solar panels on old manufacturing roofs all illustrate the tension and potential integration between the built and natural environments.</p>
                
                <p>As players restore areas, the visual palette shifts from desaturated, muted tones to vibrant, diverse colors, reflecting the return of life and vitality to previously degraded spaces.</p>
                
                <h3>Emotional Journey</h3>
                
                <p>The player's experience follows an emotional arc from isolation to community, scarcity to abundance, and powerlessness to agency. Initial challenges may feel overwhelming, but as players build relationships, skills, and resources, they develop an increasing sense of possibility and impact.</p>
                
                <p>This journey is reflected in the community's evolution as well, with initial skepticism and division gradually giving way to collaboration and shared purpose as visible improvements manifest.</p>
                
                <h3>Magical Realism Elements</h3>
                
                <p>While HomeSalad is primarily grounded in realistic systems and scenarios, it incorporates subtle magical realism through the Guardians—personifications of natural elements that appear to dedicated environmental stewards. These manifestations are ambiguous, potentially interpreted as spiritual experiences, ecological awareness, or community archetypes.</p>
                
                <p>The Guardians serve as narrative devices that connect players to deeper ecological understanding and traditional knowledge without requiring supernatural explanations. They add a layer of wonder and connection to the natural world that enriches the game's emotional landscape.</p>
