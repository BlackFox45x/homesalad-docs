                <h2>Community as Character</h2>
                <p>In HomeSalad, the community of Greenville itself functions as a character that evolves throughout the game:</p>
                
                <h3>Community States</h3>
                <p>The community progresses through several states based on player actions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fragmented:</strong> Initial state with low trust, limited cooperation, and environmental degradation</li>
                    <li><strong>Awakening:</strong> Beginning to collaborate on small projects, growing awareness of possibilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Organizing:</strong> Forming more structured initiatives, developing shared vision and resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Transforming:</strong> Implementing major projects, changing physical and social landscape</li>
                    <li><strong>Thriving:</strong> Sustainable systems in place, resilient social networks, environmental restoration</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Community Metrics</h3>
                <p>The game tracks several metrics that reflect the state of the community:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Health:</strong> Measures biodiversity, pollution levels, and ecosystem function</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Cohesion:</strong> Tracks cooperation, trust, and collective efficacy</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Resilience:</strong> Measures local economic activity, resource circulation, and self-sufficiency</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> Tracks preservation and development of sustainable practices</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Infrastructure:</strong> Measures development of community spaces and sustainable systems</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Community Voice</h3>
                <p>The community's collective perspective is expressed through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Town hall meetings where diverse viewpoints are presented</li>
                    <li>Community bulletin boards with notices and comments</li>
                    <li>Local newspaper articles that summarize community developments</li>
                    <li>Overheard conversations that change to reflect community sentiment</li>
                    <li>Visual transformations that show the physical impact of community change</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <p><strong>Design Note:</strong> The concept of "community as character" is central to HomeSalad's narrative design. While individual NPCs have their own stories and development, the collective transformation of Greenville provides the game's emotional core and measures the player's true progress.</p>
                </div>
