This bestiary catalogs the monsters that adventurers might encounter during their journeys through the Realms of the Forgotten Path.</p>
            
            <p>Each entry provides game statistics, lore, and tactical information to help Dungeon Masters incorporate these creatures into their campaigns. The monsters are organized by type and challenge rating for easy reference.</p>

                <p>The creatures in this bestiary are designed specifically for the Homesalid setting, but many can be adapted for use in other campaign worlds. Each entry includes notes on how the creature fits into the ecology and lore of Homesalid, as well as suggestions for encounters and adventure hooks.</p>
                <p>Challenge ratings (CR) are provided as a guideline, but remember that terrain, tactics, and context can significantly affect the difficulty of an encounter. Always adjust encounters to suit your party's capabilities and the story you want to tell.</p>

                            <p><strong>Mist Cloud (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The mistwalker exhales a cloud of supernatural mist in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) cold damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.</p>

                    <h4>Mistwalker Lore</h4>
                    <p>Mistwalkers are deer-like creatures native to the Shadowfen region of Homesalid. Their translucent skin reveals a ghostly outline of their skeletal structure and internal organs, giving them an eerie appearance, especially in fog or mist where they are often mistaken for spirits.</p>
                    <p>These creatures have adapted to life in the perpetually misty swamps by developing the ability to manipulate mist and fog. They use this ability both defensively to escape predators and offensively when hunting or protecting their territory.</p>
                    <p>Mistwalkers travel in small herds of 3-5 individuals and are most active at dawn and dusk. They feed primarily on a type of luminescent fungi that grows in the Shadowfen, which is believed to be the source of their supernatural abilities.</p>
                    <p>The antlers of a mistwalker are highly valued by alchemists and spellcasters for their magical properties, particularly in potions and items related to concealment and illusion.</p>

Hit: 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or lose one memory. The memory leech chooses which type of memory to target: recent (events from the past day), significant (important personal events), or skill-related (proficiency with a specific skill or tool). The effects depend on the type of memory drained:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Recent:</strong> The target has disadvantage on Intelligence checks related to events from the past day.</li>

                            <p><strong>Memory Projection (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The memory leech projects a recently consumed memory in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes stunned for 1 round as it is overwhelmed by the foreign memory. Additionally, any creature that fails the save by 5 or more also takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage.</p>

                    <h4>Memory Leech Lore</h4>
                    <p>Memory leeches are entities that exist partially in the Veil, the mysterious plane that contains forgotten memories and lost knowledge. They appear as translucent, jellyfish-like creatures with pulsing, luminescent bodies and numerous tendrils that glow with an eerie blue light.</p>
                    <p>These creatures feed on memories, particularly emotionally charged or significant ones. They are drawn to areas where the boundary between the Material Plane and the Veil is thin, such as ancient ruins, sites of great tragedy or joy, or places where powerful magic has been worked.</p>
                    <p>Memory leeches are not inherently malevolent—they feed on memories much as natural predators feed on prey. However, their feeding can have devastating effects on victims, sometimes causing permanent memory loss if multiple leeches feed on the same individual.</p>
                    <p>Scholars of the Veiled Library study these creatures to better understand the nature of memory and the Veil itself. Some mages have attempted to domesticate memory leeches to use in memory-altering spells or to recover lost memories, though such efforts are fraught with risk.</p>

                    <h4>Blightwood Shambler Lore</h4>
                    <p>Blightwood shamblers are the tragic result of magical corruption affecting treants and other sentient plant creatures. When a region's Environmental State drops to 2 or lower, the magical pollution can seep into the very essence of these ancient guardians, twisting them into corrupted versions of their former selves.</p>
                    <p>These creatures retain fragments of their former consciousness and memories, which makes them all the more tragic. They often experience moments of lucidity where they recognize what they've become, only to be overwhelmed again by pain and rage. Some have been observed trying to return to sacred groves or forests they once protected, now unwittingly spreading corruption to these areas.</p>
                    <p>Druids of the Verdant Covenant study blightwood shamblers in hopes of finding a way to reverse their corruption. They believe that if the Environmental State of a region can be improved significantly, these creatures might be healed rather than destroyed.</p>

                    <h4>Arcane Exploitation Extractor Lore</h4>
                    <p>Arcane Exploitation Extractors are specialized technicians employed by the Arcane Exploitation League to identify, tap into, and drain magical energy from ley lines with little regard for environmental consequences. They combine arcane knowledge with specialized equipment to maximize extraction efficiency.</p>
                    <p>These individuals are often recruited from academic institutions, lured by promises of unrestricted research opportunities and substantial compensation. Many begin their careers believing they're advancing magical science, only to gradually become desensitized to the environmental damage they cause.</p>
                    <p>Extractors undergo modifications that allow them to work in corrupted environments without suffering immediate effects, though long-term exposure still takes its toll. Senior extractors often show signs of corruption themselves—discolored veins, minor mutations, or unusual magical resonances.</p>
                    <p>The Arcane Exploitation League deploys extractors to newly discovered ley line sites, often with mercenary protection. They establish extraction operations that, if left unchecked, can reduce a region's Environmental State by 2-3 points within months.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vine Slam.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</p>
                            <p><strong>Thorn Spray (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The sentinel releases a spray of magical thorns in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                            <p><strong>Healing Touch (3/Day).</strong> The sentinel touches a plant creature or a patch of land no larger than 30 feet square. If it touches a plant creature, that creature regains 21 (6d6) hit points. If it touches land, the Environmental State of that area increases by 1 (maximum 10) for 24 hours.</p>

                            <h4>Reactions</h4>
                            <p><strong>Protective Growth.</strong> When a creature the sentinel can see within 30 feet of it is hit by an attack, the sentinel can cause thick vegetation to spring up around that creature, granting it a +2 bonus to AC against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss, vines and roots momentarily entangle the attacker, reducing its speed by half until the end of its next turn.</p>

                    <h4>Verdant Sentinel Lore</h4>
                    <p>Verdant Sentinels are elemental guardians created by powerful nature spirits or circles of druids to protect areas of significant environmental importance. They are composed of living plant matter infused with elemental energy and bound to a specific location such as an ancient grove, a powerful ley line nexus, or a rare ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>These guardians are intelligent and discerning, able to distinguish between those who mean harm to their protected areas and those who are merely passing through. They often observe visitors for some time before revealing themselves, judging intentions through actions rather than words.</p>
                    <p>Sentinels are deeply connected to the Environmental State of their bound regions. In healthy environments, they are vibrant and powerful, while in corrupted areas, they become weakened and may even enter dormant states to preserve their energy until the land can be healed.</p>
                    <p>The Verdant Covenant works closely with these entities, sometimes helping to create new sentinels for threatened areas. A sentinel can exist for centuries, developing unique personalities and accumulating vast knowledge about the history and ecology of their regions.</p>

                        <li>A sentinel tests the party's commitment to environmental protection before allowing them to access an ancient shrine hidden in its protected grove.</li>
                        <li>A weakened sentinel seeks help to drive off Arcane Exploitation League extractors who have begun operations in its territory.</li>
                        <li>The party discovers a dormant sentinel in a heavily corrupted area and must find a way to revitalize it to gain its ancient knowledge.</li>

                <h3>Encounter Building</h3>
                <p>When designing encounters with the creatures in this bestiary, consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Many Homesalid monsters have abilities that interact with their native environments. Use these to create more dynamic and challenging encounters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Select monsters that reinforce the themes of your campaign or adventure. For example, Veil entities work well in stories about lost knowledge or forgotten history.</li>
                    <li><strong>Factions:</strong> Consider which factions might use, study, or hunt certain monsters. This can create interesting three-way conflicts or unexpected alliances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> The statistics provided are baselines. Feel free to adjust hit points, damage, or abilities to challenge your specific party.</li>

                <h3>Monster Lore and Discovery</h3>
                <p>In Homesalid, knowledge about monsters is not always widely available. Consider using the following methods to allow characters to discover information about creatures they encounter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intelligence (Nature) or (Arcana) checks</strong> to recall basic information</li>
                    <li><strong>Research</strong> in libraries or consultation with scholars</li>
                    <li><strong>Forgotten memories</strong> that provide insight into creatures connected to the Veil</li>
                    <li><strong>Local folklore</strong> that may contain truth mixed with superstition</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Revealing monster information gradually can create memorable moments of discovery and give knowledge-focused characters opportunities to shine.</p>
