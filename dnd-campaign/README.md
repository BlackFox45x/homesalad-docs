## Connection to HomeSalad

This campaign book serves as a fantasy reflection of the HomeSalad video game. While reimagined through a magical lens, it maintains the same core themes:

- **Environmental Restoration**: Translated from gardening mechanics to magical restoration rituals
- **Community Building**: Adapted from the relationship system to the Community Bond Network
- **Resource Management**: Transformed from sustainable farming to balanced use of magical resources
- **Corporate Resistance**: Reimagined as conflict with the Blightbound Consortium

Players familiar with HomeSalad will recognize parallel locations, characters, and themes, while new players can enjoy this campaign as a standalone fantasy experience that carries meaningful environmental messages.
