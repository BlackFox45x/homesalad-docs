            <h2>Adventure Background</h2>
            <p>The Verdant Heart has long been one of the healthiest regions in Verdantis, with an Environmental State of 7-8 in most areas. The village of Greenhollow sits at the center of a network of ley lines that converge at the Verdant Spring, a magical wellspring that nourishes the surrounding forest and maintains the region's ecological balance.</p>
            
            <p>Three months ago, the Arcane Exploitation League established a mining operation in the nearby foothills, ostensibly to extract rare minerals for magical research. In reality, they're tapping directly into one of the ley lines that feeds the Verdant Spring, extracting raw magical energy using experimental and reckless methods.</p>
            
            <p>This extraction has begun corrupting the ley line, causing magical pollution to seep into the groundwater and contaminate the Verdant Spring. The corruption is subtle at first—slightly discolored water, withering plants, and minor animal illnesses—but is accelerating rapidly. If not addressed, it will cause irreversible damage to the entire ecosystem.</p>

                    <p>This alliance of druids, rangers, and nature-aligned communities has protected the Verdant Heart for generations.

Their representative, Willow Greenmantle, has arrived in Greenhollow to investigate and will become an important ally to the players.</p>

                        <p>The characters are members or allies of the Verdant Covenant who have been sent to investigate reports of environmental degradation in the Verdant Heart region.

            <h2>Part 1: Trouble in Greenhollow</h2>
            <p>The adventure begins as the characters arrive in the village of Greenhollow, located in the heart of the Verdant Heart region. The village is built in harmony with the surrounding forest, with buildings that incorporate living trees and plants into their structures.</p>

                    <h3>Greenhollow Village</h3>
                    <p>As the characters approach, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
                    <div class="read-aloud">
                        <p>The forest path opens into a sunlit clearing where the village of Greenhollow spreads before you. Unlike conventional settlements, Greenhollow seems to grow from the forest itself. Homes are built around living trees, with walls of woven branches and roofs of carefully cultivated moss and flowering vines. Bridges of twisted roots connect tree-dwellings, while ground structures blend seamlessly with the surrounding vegetation.</p>
                        <p>At the village center stands an ancient oak tree of immense proportions, its canopy spreading protectively over the settlement. At its base, a clear spring bubbles up from the earth, its waters flowing through a series of channels that irrigate gardens and provide water to the village.</p>
                        <p>As you draw closer, however, you notice concerning details. Some of the spring's channels contain water with a slight grayish tinge. Patches of plants near these channels appear wilted or discolored. Villagers gather in small groups, speaking in hushed, worried tones while occasionally glancing toward the great oak and its spring.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Key Locations in Greenhollow</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Verdant Spring</strong> - The magical spring at the base of the great oak, now showing signs of contamination</li>
                        <li><strong>The Leafy Bough Inn</strong> - A welcoming establishment built around three intertwined trees, run by Mira Oakenheart</li>
                        <li><strong>Elder's Grove</strong> - Where Elder Thorne conducts rituals and village meetings</li>
                        <li><strong>Herbalist's Cottage</strong> - Home and shop of Sage Brenna, who's been treating animals affected by the contamination</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Gardens</strong> - Shared agricultural spaces showing patchy signs of blight</li>

            <p>During their first day in Greenhollow, the characters can interact with various villagers and gather information about the environmental problems. Key NPCs include:</p>

                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A weathered half-elf with bark-like skin and hair that changes color with the seasons (currently showing hints of autumn despite it being spring).</p>
                        <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Wise and patient, but increasingly worried about the spring's corruption.</p>
                        <p><strong>Information:</strong> Elder Thorne explains that the Verdant Spring is connected to a network of ley lines that maintain the region's magical balance. He's been performing purification rituals, but the corruption is spreading faster than he can cleanse it. He suspects an external source but lacks the strength to venture far from the spring.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quest:</strong> Elder Thorne asks the characters to collect water samples from upstream sources to help identify the contamination's origin. He provides special containers enchanted to preserve the samples' magical properties.</p>

                        <p><strong>Information:</strong> Willow arrived in Greenhollow three days ago after Verdant Covenant monitoring detected a decline in the region's Environmental State.

                        <p><strong>Quest:</strong> Willow asks the characters to help her investigate the mining site, as she suspects corporate sabotage but needs evidence before the Covenant can take action.</p>

                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A middle-aged human with callused hands and clothes stained with plant dyes and medicinal preparations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Practical and knowledgeable, with a dry sense of humor that masks her concern.</p>
                        <p><strong>Information:</strong> Brenna has been treating animals affected by drinking from contaminated streams. She's collected samples of affected plants and can show the characters how the contamination manifests physically—plants with unnatural growth patterns, animals with minor mutations, and water that resists certain purification methods.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quest:</strong> Brenna needs specific herbs from the forest to create remedies, but the usual gathering spots are in areas now showing signs of corruption. She asks the characters to gather ingredients while taking precautions against exposure.</p>

                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A well-dressed dwarf with an expensive cloak and multiple rings, who seems out of place in the rustic village.</p>

                        <p><strong>Encounter:</strong> The characters might observe Dorn bribing village council members or intimidating those who speak out against the mining operation.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Assessment</h3>
            <p>During their exploration of Greenhollow, the characters can observe the effects of the declining Environmental State:</p>
            
            <div class="read-aloud">
                <p>As you move through the village and surrounding forest, you notice subtle but concerning changes in the environment. Near the spring's origin, the water remains relatively clear, but as it flows through the channels, a grayish tinge becomes more pronounced. Plants growing alongside these channels show signs of stress—leaves curling at the edges, flowers failing to bloom fully, and some younger plants withering entirely.</p>
                <p>Small animals behave unusually. Squirrels and birds move with less coordination, some appearing disoriented. A rabbit near one of the contaminated streams has patchy fur and slightly enlarged eyes that glow faintly in shadow. Fish in the clearer parts of the stream avoid the contaminated water flowing in from tributaries.</p>
                <p>Most telling is the great oak at the village center. While still magnificent, close inspection reveals sections of bark developing an ashen color, and some of its leaves have an unnatural bluish tint at their edges. The magical aura that once radiated visibly from the tree has dimmed, flickering like a candle in the wind.</p>

                <h3>Environmental State Mechanics</h3>
                <p>This section of the adventure demonstrates the Environmental State System in action. The Verdant Heart region normally maintains an Environmental State of 7-8, but the area around Greenhollow has declined to 5 and continues to drop as the corruption spreads.</p>
                <p>Characters with proficiency in Nature, Survival, or Arcana can make checks (DC 12) to assess the Environmental State more precisely. Druids, rangers, and characters with the Nature Warden or Reclaimer backgrounds have advantage on these checks.</p>
                <p>As the adventure progresses, the Environmental State will continue to decline unless the characters take action, with increasingly severe consequences for the ecosystem and the village.</p>

                <h3>Environmental Restoration</h3>
                <p>Throughout this adventure, characters will learn and apply various restoration techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Cleanup:</strong> Removing contaminated soil, redirecting water flow, and planting purifying vegetation</li>
                    <li><strong>Magical Purification:</strong> Casting restoration spells, performing cleansing rituals, and creating magical filters</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Organization:</strong> Rallying villagers to assist in restoration efforts, teaching sustainable practices, and building community bonds</li>
                    <li><strong>Ley Line Repair:</strong> Healing the damaged ley line and redirecting its flow away from the mining operation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These activities directly improve the Environmental State and establish Community Bonds that will benefit the characters throughout the campaign.</p>

                <h3>Adventure Continuation</h3>
                <p>This starter adventure serves as an introduction to the environmental themes of the Verdantis campaign and leads directly into Chapter 1: Seeds of Renewal. Characters who complete this adventure should advance to 3rd level and gain their first connections to the Verdant Covenant and other environmental factions.</p>
                <p>The mining operation is just one of many environmental threats facing Verdantis, and the characters' actions here will establish their reputation as guardians of the natural world.</p>
