            <h2>Environmental Magic Items</h2>
            <p class="fancy-initial">The magic items of Verdantis reflect the world's deep connection to nature and the ongoing struggle between environmental restoration and corruption. Many of these items were created during the Age of Harmony, when the Great Covenant between mortals and nature spirits was at its strongest. Others are more recent creations, forged by those dedicated to healing the wounded world.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                "A true magical artifact is not merely a tool of power, but a vessel of purpose. The items we create today must serve the restoration of tomorrow."
                <cite>— Archmage Thalia Greenweaver, Verdant Covenant Artificer</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>The items in this collection are organized by rarity and theme. Many interact directly with the Environmental State System, becoming more powerful in healthier environments or helping to restore corrupted areas.</p>

        <!-- Restoration Items -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Restoration Items</h2>
            <p>These items are specifically designed to help restore corrupted environments and heal the damage done to Verdantis.</p>
            
            <div class="magic-item">
                <h3>Seedling of Renewal <span class="rarity">(Uncommon)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item, requires attunement by a druid, ranger, or character with proficiency in Nature</em></p>
                
                <p>This small, ever-blooming seedling is contained in a crystal vial filled with glowing water. The seedling pulses with gentle green light in the presence of corruption.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As an action, you can plant the seedling in corrupted soil. It immediately takes root and grows into a small sapling. Over the next 24 hours, the sapling purifies the soil in a 10-foot radius, increasing the Environmental State of that small area by 1 (maximum 7).</li>
                    <li>After being planted, the seedling returns to its vial after 24 hours, ready to be used again. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                    <li>While carrying the seedling, you have advantage on checks made to identify sources of environmental corruption.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In areas with Environmental State 7 or higher, the seedling's purification radius increases to 20 feet. In areas with Environmental State 3 or lower, using the seedling requires a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the seedling wilts for 1d4 days before regaining its power.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="magic-item">
                <h3>Purifier's Staff <span class="rarity">(Rare)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Staff, requires attunement by a spellcaster</em></p>
                
                <p>This wooden staff is made from a branch of a tree that grew in a pristine environment. Crystal formations grow naturally along its length, and it feels warm to the touch.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties until it spends a full day in an area with Environmental State 8 or higher.</li>
                    <li>While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: purify food and drink (1 charge), lesser restoration (2 charges), plant growth (3 charges), or control water (4 charges).</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can plant the staff in the ground and expend 5 charges to create a 30-foot-radius zone of purification. Within this zone, the Environmental State is temporarily increased by 2 (maximum 8) for 1 hour. Corrupted creatures that enter or start their turn in this area must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d8 radiant damage.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In areas with Environmental State 5 or higher, spells cast from the staff that restore hit points heal an additional amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. In areas with Environmental State 2 or lower, the staff has only half the normal number of charges.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="magic-item">
                <h3>Verdant Heart Amulet <span class="rarity">(Very Rare)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item, requires attunement</em></p>
                
                <p>This amulet contains a small fragment of the Great Ley Line Confluence from the Verdant Heart. It pulses with emerald light and feels like a living thing against your skin.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While wearing this amulet, you gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.</li>
                    <li>You can cast the following spells from the amulet: detect poison and disease (at will), protection from poison (3/day), and heal (1/day, but only to cure poison or disease).</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can activate the amulet to create a 60-foot-radius cleansing aura centered on you. This aura neutralizes all non-magical poisons and diseases affecting creatures or present in objects or the environment. Magical poisons and diseases are suppressed while creatures or objects remain in the aura. Additionally, the Environmental State within the aura is temporarily increased by 3 (maximum 9) for 10 minutes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In areas with Environmental State 8 or higher, the amulet's cleansing aura also removes one level of exhaustion from all creatures within it. In areas with Environmental State 0-1, using the amulet's cleansing aura property requires you to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Protection Items</h2>
            <p>These items help protect their bearers from the effects of corruption and environmental hazards.</p>
            
            <div class="magic-item">
                <h3>Cloak of Environmental Adaptation <span class="rarity">(Uncommon)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>
                
                <p>This cloak shifts its appearance to match the environment around it. In forests, it appears as a tapestry of leaves; near water, it ripples like the surface of a lake; in corrupted areas, it takes on a protective, sealed appearance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While wearing this cloak, you are naturally adapted to hot and cold climates, as if under the effect of the endure elements spell.</li>
                    <li>The cloak grants you advantage on saving throws against environmental hazards, such as extreme weather, natural poisons, or difficult terrain caused by natural features.</li>
                    <li>In areas with Environmental State 3 or lower, the cloak provides resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition caused by environmental corruption.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In areas with Environmental State 7 or higher, the cloak also grants you a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. In areas with Environmental State 0-1, the cloak's protective properties function normally, but it appears visibly strained, with its colors fading and its fabric becoming brittle.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="magic-item">
                <h3>Guardian's Totem <span class="rarity">(Rare)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item, requires attunement</em></p>
                
                <p>This small wooden totem is carved in the shape of a local guardian animal (bear, wolf, eagle, etc.) and is inlaid with natural materials like amber, shell, or stone.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While carrying this totem, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks and on saving throws against effects that would reduce your maximum hit points.</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can activate the totem to gain the following benefits for 1 minute: resistance to one damage type of your choice (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison), advantage on Constitution saving throws, and immunity to the frightened condition. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                    <li>If you are in an area with Environmental State 3 or lower, you can use your reaction when you take damage to activate the totem's protective aura, reducing the damage by 2d8. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until you complete a short or long rest.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In areas with Environmental State 6 or higher, the totem's damage reduction increases to 3d8. In areas with Environmental State 0-1, the totem's protective properties only function for 1 round before requiring a short or long rest to recharge.</p>

                <h3>Harmony Stone <span class="rarity">(Uncommon)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>
                
                <p>This smooth river stone is etched with symbols representing community and nature in balance. It feels pleasantly warm when held by someone with positive intentions toward a community.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While carrying this stone, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with members of a community where you have established a Bond Level of 1 or higher.</li>
                    <li>As an action, you can place the stone on the ground and activate it, creating a 30-foot-radius zone of harmony. Within this zone, hostile creatures must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become indisposed to violence for 1 minute. Affected creatures can still defend themselves but will not initiate attacks unless directly threatened. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                    <li>When you successfully complete a task that would increase your Bond Level with a community, you can use the stone to add a +1 bonus to the community's Environmental State (maximum 8) for 1d4 days.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In communities with Bond Level 3 or higher, the stone's harmony zone has a DC of 15 instead of 13. In areas with Environmental State 2 or lower, the stone's properties only function if at least three community members willingly touch the stone together as part of a small ritual.</p>

                <h3>Banner of Unified Purpose <span class="rarity">(Rare)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>
                
                <p>This banner is woven from materials gathered from various communities throughout Verdantis. Its design changes subtly to incorporate symbols meaningful to the nearest settlement.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While carrying this unfurled banner, you and allies within 30 feet gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.</li>
                    <li>When you plant the banner in the ground, you can use an action to activate its rallying power. All allies within 60 feet who can see the banner gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Additionally, for the next hour, any restoration activities performed within sight of the banner are considered to have advantage on their associated checks. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                    <li>If you are in a community with Bond Level 2 or higher, you can conduct a 10-minute ceremony with at least five community members around the planted banner. At the end of the ceremony, the community's Bond Level is treated as one level higher for the purpose of determining what assistance they can provide, lasting for 24 hours.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Environmental Interaction:</strong> In areas with Environmental State 6 or higher, the banner's rallying power also grants advantage on the first saving throw made by each affected ally. In communities with Bond Level 4 or higher, the banner can be used to coordinate community-wide restoration efforts, adding a +2 bonus to all Environmental State improvement checks for one day.</p>

                <h3>The Verdant Heart <span class="rarity">(Artifact)</span></h3>
                <p><em>Wondrous item, requires attunement by a character committed to environmental restoration</em></p>
                
                <p>This crystalline orb contains what appears to be a miniature ecosystem—forests, mountains, rivers, and oceans all swirling within its depths. It pulses with the rhythm of a heartbeat and feels warm to the touch.</p>
                
                <p><strong>History:</strong> The Verdant Heart was created during the Age of Harmony as the physical manifestation of the Great Covenant between mortals and nature spirits. It was hidden away when the covenant began to fracture, its power too great to risk falling into exploitative hands. Legends say it contains a perfect model of Verdantis as it once was, and that it holds the power to restore the world to that state.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attunement:</strong> To attune to the Verdant Heart, you must spend 24 hours in meditation within an area of Environmental State 7 or higher. During this time, you experience visions of Verdantis as it was during the Age of Harmony and as it could be again. At the end of this period, you must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you attune to the artifact; on a failure, you are overwhelmed by the visions and gain a level of exhaustion, but may try again after a long rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spells:</strong> While attuned to the Verdant Heart, you can cast the following spells from it (save DC 18): plant growth (at will), control water (at will), commune with nature (at will), heal (3/day), regenerate (1/day), and control weather (1/day).</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Restoration:</strong> As an action, you can place the Verdant Heart on the ground and channel its power into the surrounding environment. This creates a wave of restorative energy that spreads outward at a rate of 1 mile per day for 7 days. This wave increases the Environmental State of all areas it passes through by 1d4 (maximum 10). Once this property is used, it can't be used again for 7 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corruption Cleansing:</strong> You can target a corrupted creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, all corruption effects are removed from the creature, and it is restored to its natural state if possible. If the creature has been corrupted beyond restoration, it is instead banished to a pocket dimension within the Verdant Heart, where it will slowly heal over time. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Unification:</strong> When brought to a community, the Verdant Heart automatically increases that community's Bond Level with all other communities by 1 (maximum 5) for as long as the Heart remains there. Additionally, all restoration activities performed by that community have advantage on their associated checks.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Curse:</strong> The Arcane Exploitation League and other exploitative organizations will stop at nothing to obtain the Verdant Heart. While attuned to it, you are magically trackable by those who seek to misuse its power, and you may be targeted by powerful enemies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Destroying the Verdant Heart:</strong> The Verdant Heart cannot be destroyed by conventional means. It can only be unmade if it is brought to the exact center of the Great Ley Line Confluence in the Verdant Heart region and used to fully restore the Environmental State of the entire continent to 10. In this case, the artifact dissolves into pure magical energy that spreads throughout the land, permanently stabilizing the environment of Verdantis.</p>
