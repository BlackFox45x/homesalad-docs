            <h2>Introduction to the Core Rules</h2>
            <p class="fancy-initial">Welcome to the Core Rules for Homesalid: Realms of the Forgotten Path. This rulebook contains all the essential information you need to play in this unique campaign setting focused on environmental restoration and community building. While this campaign uses the fifth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game as its foundation, we've added several setting-specific rules and mechanics that emphasize the themes of environmental stewardship and community bonds.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                "The rules of nature and magic are intertwined. When we respect one, we honor the other. When we exploit one, we damage both."
                <cite>— Elderoak, Ancient Guardian of the Verdant Heart</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>This rulebook assumes you are familiar with the basic concepts of tabletop roleplaying games, including character creation, ability scores, skill checks, combat, and spellcasting. If you're new to roleplaying games, we recommend reviewing the basic rules of fifth edition before diving into the setting-specific content presented here.</p>
            
            <p>The unique mechanics in this campaign—particularly the Environmental State System and Community Bond Network—provide concrete ways for players to engage with environmental and community themes through gameplay, making these elements an integral part of the heroic journey rather than just background flavor.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
            
            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>Homesalid uses the same core d20 system as the fifth edition rules:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Roll a d20 and add relevant modifiers</li>
                <li>Compare the result to a target number (DC)</li>
                <li>If the result equals or exceeds the DC, the check succeeds</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Unique Mechanics</h3>
            <p>The following mechanics are unique to the Homesalid campaign setting:</p>
            
            <div class="accordion single-open">
                <div class="accordion-header">Environmental State System</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The Environmental State System is a core mechanic that measures the health of different regions in Verdantis on a scale from 0 (completely corrupted) to 10 (pristine and flourishing):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Environmental State 0-2 (Critical):</strong> Severely corrupted areas where magic is unstable, creatures are twisted by corruption, and survival itself is challenging. Spellcasting requires DC 15 Constitution checks to avoid wild magic surges, and living creatures take 1d6 corruption damage per day unless protected.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental State 3-4 (Degraded):</strong> Noticeably damaged environments with weakened magic and unhealthy ecosystems. Spellcasting requires DC 10 Constitution checks, and natural healing is halved.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental State 5-6 (Stressed):</strong> Environments showing signs of strain but still functional. Minor penalties to nature-based skill checks, but no direct effects on spellcasting or healing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental State 7-8 (Healthy):</strong> Thriving environments with strong magical currents. Characters gain advantage on nature-based skill checks and recover an additional hit die during long rests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental State 9-10 (Pristine):</strong> Exceptionally vibrant environments with powerful, stable magic. Spellcasters add their proficiency bonus to spell damage or healing once per short rest, and characters gain temporary hit points equal to their Constitution modifier after each long rest.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Players can improve the Environmental State through specific restoration activities, successful quests, and consistent environmental stewardship. Each point increase represents a significant milestone in healing the land.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="accordion-header">Community Bond Network</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The Community Bond Network tracks relationships between player characters and the communities they interact with throughout Verdantis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each settlement or community has a Bond Level ranging from 0 (Strangers) to 5 (Integral Members)</li>
                        <li>Bond Levels increase through completing quests for the community, teaching sustainable practices, defending against threats, and participating in community events</li>
                        <li>Higher Bond Levels provide mechanical benefits such as discounted goods and services, access to unique resources, safe havens for rest, and assistance from community members</li>
                        <li>Communities with higher Bond Levels are more likely to adopt sustainable practices that improve the Environmental State of their region</li>
                        <li>The network creates a web of relationships that can be called upon for aid during the campaign's major challenges</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Community Bond Network sheet (available in the Player Resources section) helps players track their relationships with different settlements and the specific benefits they've unlocked.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="accordion-header">Ley Line Magic</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The world of Verdantis is crisscrossed with magical ley lines that influence spellcasting. The health of these ley lines directly correlates with the Environmental State of the region:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In regions with Environmental State 7-10, ley lines are vibrant and powerful. Spellcasters can tap into them with a DC 10 Arcana check to enhance their magic (increased range, duration, or potency)</li>
                        <li>In regions with Environmental State 5-6, ley lines function normally but offer no special benefits</li>
                        <li>In regions with Environmental State 3-4, ley lines are weakened and unstable. Failed spellcasting checks may result in diminished effects</li>
                        <li>In regions with Environmental State 0-2, ley lines are corrupted or dormant. Spellcasting is unpredictable and may result in wild magic surges or spell failure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Restoring corrupted ley lines is often a key objective in improving a region's Environmental State, requiring specialized rituals and the cleansing of corruption sources.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="accordion-header">Restoration Activities</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Characters can perform specific activities to help restore damaged environments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Physical Restoration:</strong> Cleaning pollution, planting vegetation, creating wildlife habitats. Uses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution checks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Magical Purification:</strong> Cleansing corrupted magic, stabilizing ley lines, dispelling harmful effects. Uses spellcasting ability checks or specific restoration spells.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spiritual Renewal:</strong> Reconnecting with nature spirits, performing renewal rituals, strengthening the bond between communities and their environment. Uses Wisdom or Charisma checks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Teaching sustainable practices to communities, researching ancient environmental techniques, documenting ecological information. Uses Intelligence checks or tool proficiencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These activities can be performed during downtime or as part of adventures. Success contributes to improving the Environmental State of a region, with multiple successful activities eventually raising the state by one point.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Challenges and Rewards</h2>
            <p>The environmental focus of this campaign introduces unique challenges and rewards:</p>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Environmental Challenges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corruption Exposure:</strong> Extended time in severely corrupted areas (Environmental State 0-2) may result in corruption exposure. Characters must make Constitution saving throws or gain levels of corruption that cause debilitating effects until cleansed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magical Instability:</strong> Corrupted regions experience unpredictable magical phenomena, from spell failures to wild magic surges to temporary dead magic zones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corrupted Creatures:</strong> Animals and plants twisted by corruption become more aggressive and develop unnatural abilities, creating unique combat encounters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Scarcity:</strong> Degraded environments produce fewer resources, making survival more challenging and increasing competition among communities.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Environmental Rewards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Restoration Boons:</strong> Characters who significantly contribute to environmental restoration may receive boons from nature spirits, granting minor magical abilities tied to the restored region.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Higher Bond Levels with communities provide tangible benefits like discounted services, unique equipment, safe havens, and NPC assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magical Abundance:</strong> Restored regions (Environmental State 7-10) provide enhanced magical effects, better natural healing, and access to rare magical components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legacy Impact:</strong> Changes to the Environmental State persist throughout the campaign, allowing players to see the long-term impact of their efforts as regions transform from corrupted wastelands to thriving ecosystems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>These mechanics ensure that environmental restoration isn't just a narrative backdrop but an integral part of gameplay with meaningful mechanical consequences.</p>
