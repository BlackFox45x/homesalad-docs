Creating a character for this campaign means crafting a hero whose personal journey is intertwined with the fate of the natural world and the communities that depend on it.</p>

            <p>This guide will walk you through creating a character uniquely suited to the environmental and community themes of the Homesalid: Realms of the Forgotten Path campaign. While you can use any official D&D 5e character options, this guide focuses on the custom options designed specifically for this setting.</p>

                <p>The character concepts and roles in this campaign are fantasy reflections of the player's journey in the HomeSalad video game. Just as the HomeSalad player progresses from newcomer to community leader while restoring the environment, your D&D character will follow a similar heroic path in a magical context.</p>

            <p>A unique aspect of character creation for this campaign is defining your character's relationship with the natural world. This connection influences how you interact with the Environmental State System and what special abilities you might develop as you restore corrupted regions.</p>

                <div class="column">

                    <p>Choose one or two environmental affinities that represent the types of ecosystems your character is most connected to:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Urban Affinity:</strong> Connection to the intersection of civilization and nature</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your affinity grants advantage on Environmental State checks in corresponding regions and may unlock special restoration abilities for those environments.</p>

                        <li><strong>Redemption:</strong> You once contributed to environmental harm and seek to make amends</li>
                    </ul>
