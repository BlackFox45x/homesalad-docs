                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <p>This section details the quest design philosophy, structure, and systems in HomeSalad, including main storyline quests, faction quests, personal quests, and emergent objectives.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Quest Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>HomeSalad's quest design is guided by several core principles:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meaningful Choices:</strong> Quests present players with decisions that have tangible consequences for the narrative, world, and relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Systemic Integration:</strong> Quests connect to and utilize the game's core systems rather than existing as isolated content</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Solutions:</strong> Most quests can be approached in different ways based on player skills, relationships, and preferences</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Context:</strong> Quests are tied to specific locations and environmental conditions, making the setting integral to the experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Impact:</strong> Quest outcomes visibly affect the community and environment, providing clear feedback on player actions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Quest Categories</h2>
                <p>HomeSalad features several categories of quests, each with distinct characteristics and purposes:</p>
                
                <div class="quest-category">
                    <h3>Main Story Quests</h3>
                    <p>These quests drive the central narrative of HomeSalad, focusing on the conflict with MegaGrow Industries and the transformation of Greenville. They are structured in a three-act format corresponding to the game's three-year cycle.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Significant narrative impact with major decision points</li>
                        <li>Involvement of multiple factions and key characters</li>
                        <li>Large-scale environmental and community changes</li>
                        <li>Multi-stage objectives with varied gameplay</li>
                        <li>Memorable set-piece moments and events</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Main story quests follow a branching structure where player choices in earlier quests affect the available options and outcomes in later quests. Each year culminates in a major community event that serves as a narrative climax.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="quest-category">
                    <h3>Faction Quests</h3>
                    <p>These quests are associated with specific factions in Greenville and allow players to develop their standing with these groups. Each faction offers a questline that reflects its values, goals, and methods.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alignment with faction values and objectives</li>
                        <li>Reputation rewards and faction-specific benefits</li>
                        <li>Potential conflicts with opposing faction interests</li>

                        <li>Character development for faction members</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Faction quests are organized in tiers that unlock as player reputation increases. Higher-tier quests offer more significant rewards and narrative development but may also create more tension with opposing factions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="quest-category">
                    <h3>Personal Quests</h3>
                    <p>These quests focus on individual characters and their personal stories, allowing players to develop deeper relationships with NPCs and help them overcome challenges or achieve goals.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>

                        <li>Unique rewards including skills, items, or knowledge</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Personal quests typically unfold in 3-5 stages as relationships develop, with each stage revealing more about the character and presenting new challenges or opportunities for connection.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="quest-category">
                    <h3>Community Projects</h3>
                    <p>These are collaborative objectives that involve multiple community members working toward a shared goal, such as building infrastructure, organizing events, or addressing environmental challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Community projects have a preparation phase, a resource gathering phase, an implementation phase, and a celebration/benefit phase. Players can contribute at different stages based on their skills and interests.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="quest-category">
                    <h3>Emergent Quests</h3>
                    <p>These quests arise dynamically from the game's systems and world state, responding to player actions, environmental conditions, and community needs.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generated based on current game state and conditions</li>

                        <li>Integrated with environmental and community systems</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Emergent quests follow templates that are populated with contextually appropriate details based on current conditions, creating unique combinations of objectives, locations, and rewards.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Quest Structure</h2>
                <p>While quest structure varies by category, most quests in HomeSalad follow a general pattern:</p>

                <h3>Quest Flow</h3>
                <p>The typical flow of a quest in HomeSalad:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Player learns about the quest through exploration, conversation, or events</li>
                    <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> Player gathers information about the situation and possible approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Player decides how to approach the quest based on their skills and resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Player carries out their chosen approach, adapting to challenges</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Points:</strong> Player makes key choices that affect the outcome</li>
                    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The quest concludes with consequences based on player actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The world and characters react to the quest outcome</li>

                <h2>Quest Design Examples</h2>
                <p>The following examples illustrate how HomeSalad's quest design principles are applied to different quest types:</p>
                
                <div class="example-quest">
                    <h3>Main Story Quest Example: "Watershed Moment"</h3>
                    <p><strong>Context:</strong> MegaGrow plans to divert water from the Green River for their industrial farm, threatening Greenville's water supply and riparian ecosystem.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gather evidence of MegaGrow's water diversion plans</li>
                        <li>Develop a community water management alternative</li>
                        <li>Present the case at the City Council meeting</li>
                        <li>Implement the chosen water management solution</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Choices:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to obtain evidence (infiltration, legal research, whistleblower)</li>
                        <li>What alternative to propose (traditional methods, high-tech solution, hybrid approach)</li>
                        <li>How to address MegaGrow's arguments (economic, environmental, community-focused)</li>
                        <li>Which allies to involve (affects available resources and political support)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The river's fate is determined, affecting water availability, ecosystem health, and community-corporate relations. The physical environment visibly changes based on the outcome, and water-related gameplay is permanently affected.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How to preserve the knowledge (digital documentation, apprenticeship, community seed library)</li>
                        <li>Which varieties to prioritize (based on cultural significance, adaptation to climate change, culinary value)</li>

                <h2>Quest Tracking and Management</h2>
                <p>HomeSalad provides several tools for players to track and manage quests:</p>
                
                <h3>Journal System</h3>
                <p>The player's journal serves as the primary quest tracking tool, with several sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Active Quests:</strong> Currently accepted and in-progress quests</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Quest Markers and Indicators</h3>
                <p>The game world includes subtle indicators for quest-related elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Character Indicators:</strong> Visual cues for NPCs with available quests or updates</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Highlights:</strong> Environmental cues for quest-relevant areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Map Markers:</strong> Optional indicators on the world map (can be toggled)</li>

                <h3>Quest Prioritization</h3>
                <p>Players can prioritize quests in their journal, which affects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which quest objectives appear in the HUD</li>
                    <li>Which quest locations are highlighted on the map</li>
                    <li>Which quest-related dialogue options are emphasized</li>
                    <li>Notifications for quest-relevant opportunities</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <p><strong>Design Note:</strong> Quest design in HomeSalad emphasizes player agency and systemic integration. Rather than treating quests as a separate content layer, they are designed to work with and highlight the game's core systems of environmental transformation, community building, and sustainable living.</p>
