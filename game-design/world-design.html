                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <p>This section details the world design of HomeSalad, including the layout of Greenville, environmental transformation systems, level design principles, and world interaction mechanics.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>World Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>HomeSalad's world design is guided by several core principles:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Environment:</strong> The world visibly changes in response to player actions, providing clear feedback and a sense of impact</li>
                    <li><strong>Ecological Authenticity:</strong> Environmental systems follow realistic ecological principles while remaining accessible and engaging</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaningful Spaces:</strong> Each area serves narrative, gameplay, and aesthetic purposes rather than existing solely for exploration</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Context:</strong> The world reflects the community's history, values, and social dynamics through its design</li>
                    <li><strong>Layered Discovery:</strong> The environment reveals deeper levels of detail and interaction as players develop skills and relationships</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>World Structure</h2>
                <p>The world of HomeSalad is centered around the town of Greenville and its surrounding areas, divided into distinct districts with unique characteristics and challenges.</p>
                
                <h3>World Scale</h3>
                <p>HomeSalad uses a compressed scale that balances realism with gameplay considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The town of Greenville is approximately 1 square kilometer in gameplay terms</li>
                    <li>Walking from one end of town to the other takes approximately 5-7 minutes of real time</li>
                    <li>Each district is sized to feel distinct while allowing reasonable travel times</li>
                    <li>Scale compression is more pronounced for agricultural and natural areas</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>World Map</h3>
                <p>The world map is divided into five main districts, each with distinct visual identity, gameplay opportunities, and environmental challenges:</p>
                
                <div class="district-section">
                    <h4>Rust Belt District (Northwest)</h4>

                    <p><strong>Environmental Challenges:</strong> Soil contamination, structural decay, water pollution, lack of biodiversity</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="district-section">
                    <h4>Downtown Commons (Center)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Visual Identity:</strong> Historic buildings, central plaza, mixed-use structures, public spaces, small businesses</p>

                    <p><strong>Environmental Challenges:</strong> Limited green space, impervious surfaces, heat island effect, resource distribution</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="district-section">
                    <h4>Riverside Heights (Northeast)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Visual Identity:</strong> Older homes, established gardens, riverside paths, heritage trees, traditional architecture</p>
                    <p><strong>Gameplay Focus:</strong> Traditional gardening, knowledge preservation, riparian restoration, community traditions</p>
                    <p><strong>Environmental Challenges:</strong> Riverbank erosion, flooding risk, invasive species, aging infrastructure</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="district-section">
                    <h4>Meadowbrook Suburbs (Southwest)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Visual Identity:</strong> Post-war homes, manicured lawns, cul-de-sacs, schools, parks, uniform aesthetics</p>
                    <p><strong>Gameplay Focus:</strong> Lawn conversion, neighborhood organizing, educational programs, family engagement</p>
                    <p><strong>Environmental Challenges:</strong> Monoculture lawns, chemical dependencies, water waste, social conformity</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="district-section">
                    <h4>Brightwater Shores (Southeast)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Visual Identity:</strong> Lakeside properties, upscale homes, recreational facilities, scenic viewpoints, decorative landscaping</p>
                    <p><strong>Gameplay Focus:</strong> Water quality improvement, sustainable luxury, influential stakeholder engagement</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Connectivity</h3>
                <p>Districts are connected through several systems that facilitate movement and create a cohesive world:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Road Network:</strong> Main streets and side roads that provide primary navigation routes</li>
                    <li><strong>Green River:</strong> A waterway that flows through multiple districts, serving as both boundary and connector</li>
                    <li><strong>Greenway Trails:</strong> Pedestrian and bicycle paths that develop as players restore natural corridors</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Transportation:</strong> Bus routes that can be improved through community projects</li>
                    <li><strong>Viewsheds:</strong> Scenic overlooks that provide visual connections between areas</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Environmental Transformation System</h2>
                <p>A core feature of HomeSalad's world design is the Environmental Transformation System (ETS), which allows players to visibly change the environment through their actions.</p>
                
                <h3>Transformation Stages</h3>
                <p>Most areas in the game can progress through five stages of environmental health:</p>

                <h3>Transformation Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Players transform the environment through several interrelated mechanics:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct Actions:</strong> Planting, building, cleaning, and restoring specific elements</li>
                    <li><strong>System Implementation:</strong> Creating water management, soil building, and habitat systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance Activities:</strong> Regular care that prevents degradation and supports improvement</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Projects:</strong> Larger-scale transformations that require collective effort</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Changes:</strong> Working with the City Council to implement supportive regulations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Transformation occurs at multiple scales:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Micro:</strong> Individual garden beds, rain gardens, or habitat features (immediate feedback)</li>
                    <li><strong>Meso:</strong> Neighborhood parks, community gardens, or stream sections (medium-term projects)</li>
                    <li><strong>Macro:</strong> District-wide green infrastructure, watershed restoration (long-term initiatives)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Transformation Metrics</h3>
                <p>The game tracks several metrics to determine environmental state:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity Index:</strong> Variety and abundance of plant and animal species</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Quality Rating:</strong> Cleanliness and health of water bodies</li>
