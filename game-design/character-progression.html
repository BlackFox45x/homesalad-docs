                <h2>Progression Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Character progression in HomeSalad is designed around several core principles:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learning by Doing:</strong> Skills improve primarily through practice and application rather than abstract point allocation</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Progression Paths:</strong> Players can advance through various complementary systems rather than a single linear path</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaningful Choices:</strong> Specialization requires investment and trade-offs, making character build decisions significant</li>
                    <li><strong>Visible Impact:</strong> Progression visibly affects the game world, character capabilities, and social dynamics</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Individual progression is tied to community development, emphasizing interdependence</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Skill System</h2>
                <p>The skill system represents the player character's practical abilities and technical knowledge. Skills improve through use and application in relevant activities.</p>

                <h3>Skill Levels</h3>
                <p>Each skill progresses through five levels of mastery:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Novice:</strong> Basic understanding and capability, occasional failures, limited efficiency</li>
                    <li><strong>Apprentice:</strong> Reliable performance of standard techniques, improved resource efficiency</li>
                    <li><strong>Practitioner:</strong> Expanded techniques, good resource efficiency, ability to teach basics</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert:</strong> Advanced techniques, excellent resource efficiency, ability to innovate</li>
                    <li><strong>Master:</strong> Complete mastery, maximum efficiency, ability to create unique solutions</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Skill Progression Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Skills improve through several mechanisms:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Performing activities related to the skill (primary method)</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Reading books, attending workshops, or being taught by NPCs</li>
                    <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Trying new approaches or combinations of techniques</li>
                    <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> Sharing knowledge with NPCs or other players</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Completing specific skill-related tasks or quests</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Skill progression follows a curve where early levels are achieved relatively quickly, while mastery requires significant dedication and practice.</p>
                
                <h2>Knowledge System</h2>
                <p>The knowledge system represents information, insights, and understanding that the player character accumulates. Unlike skills, knowledge is not measured in levels but as discrete pieces of information that can be collected, connected, and applied.</p>
                
                <h3>Knowledge Categories</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ecological:</strong> Information about local ecosystems, species interactions, and environmental processes</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Specific techniques, recipes, blueprints, and methodologies</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural:</strong> Local history, traditions, stories, and community knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal:</strong> Information about specific characters, their preferences, histories, and relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Systemic:</strong> Understanding of how different systems interact and affect each other</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Knowledge Acquisition</h3>
                <p>Players can gain knowledge through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conversations with NPCs</li>
                    <li>Reading books and documents</li>
                    <li>Observation of natural phenomena</li>
                    <li>Experimentation and testing</li>
                    <li>Attending community events and workshops</li>
                    <li>Completing quests and challenges</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Knowledge Web</h3>
                <p>Knowledge in HomeSalad is represented as an interconnected web rather than a linear progression. As players discover new information, they can connect it to existing knowledge to unlock insights, new dialogue options, and special actions.</p>
                
                <p>The Knowledge Web is visualized in the player's journal, showing connections between different pieces of information and highlighting areas where knowledge is incomplete.</p>
                
                <!-- Image: Knowledge Web Diagram -->
                <figure class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/knowledge-web.jpg" alt="A complex, interconnected web diagram representing various knowledge nodes and relationships">
                    <figcaption>
                        <strong>AI Prompt:</strong> “A high-detail illustration of a ‘knowledge web’ with interconnected nodes labeled ‘Ecological,’ ‘Technical,’ ‘Cultural,’ ‘Personal,’ and ‘Systemic.’ Lines and icons demonstrate how discovered information links together; modern UI/UX style, bright and engaging.”
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <h2>Relationship System</h2>
                <p>The relationship system tracks the player's connections with individual NPCs and factions, reflecting how their actions and choices affect their standing in the community.</p>
                
                <h3>Individual Relationships</h3>
                <p>Relationships with individual NPCs are measured along three dimensions:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trust:</strong> How much the NPC believes in the player's reliability and intentions</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> How much the NPC values the player's skills and accomplishments</li>
                    <li><strong>Affinity:</strong> How much the NPC personally likes and connects with the player</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These dimensions can develop independently based on player actions. For example, an NPC might respect the player's gardening skills while not fully trusting their intentions, or might have high affinity but low respect.</p>
                
                <h3>Relationship Development</h3>
                <p>Relationships develop through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dialogue choices that reveal character values and perspectives</li>
                    <li>Completing personal quests for NPCs</li>
                    <li>Including NPCs in community projects</li>
                    <li>Regular interactions and activities</li>
                    <li>Gift-giving based on NPC preferences</li>
                    <li>Supporting (or opposing) NPC goals and values</li>
