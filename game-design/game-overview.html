                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <p>This section provides a high-level overview of HomeSalad, including its core concept, target audience, unique selling points, and gameplay pillars.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Core Concept</h2>
                <p>HomeSalad is a community-building RPG with gardening mechanics and environmental activism themes. Players take on the role of a newcomer to Greenville, a town facing economic hardship, environmental degradation, and corporate takeover threats. Through sustainable practices, community organizing, and environmental restoration, players work to transform Greenville into a thriving, resilient community.</p>
                
                <p>The game combines elements of farming simulators, town-building games, and narrative RPGs to create a unique experience centered around sustainability, community resilience, and environmental stewardship.</p>
                
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>HomeSalad is designed to appeal to several overlapping player demographics:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Farming/Life Sim Enthusiasts:</strong> Players who enjoy games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrative RPG Players:</strong> Those who appreciate character-driven stories and meaningful choices</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Enthusiasts:</strong> People interested in sustainability, permaculture, and environmental issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Builders:</strong> Players who enjoy social simulation and community management games</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational Gamers:</strong> Those looking to learn about sustainable practices through engaging gameplay</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The game is designed to be accessible to casual players while offering depth for those who want to engage more deeply with its systems and themes.</p>
                
                <h2>Unique Selling Points</h2>
                
                <div class="usp-section">
                    <h3>Environmental Transformation System</h3>
                    <p>Unlike most games where the environment is static or changes only through scripted events, HomeSalad features a dynamic environmental system where player actions directly and visibly transform the landscape. Areas progress from degraded to restored states through player interventions, with visual feedback, gameplay benefits, and narrative recognition.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="usp-section">
                    <h3>Community as Character</h3>
                    <p>The town of Greenville functions as a character that evolves throughout the game. The community has its own metrics, personality, and development arc that responds to player actions. Rather than focusing solely on individual relationships, HomeSalad emphasizes collective transformation and social dynamics.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="usp-section">
                    <h3>Integrated Knowledge Systems</h3>
                    <p>HomeSalad incorporates multiple knowledge systems (traditional ecological knowledge, scientific understanding, practical skills, and systems thinking) that players can learn and integrate. This approach respects diverse ways of knowing and encourages players to combine insights from different perspectives.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="usp-section">
                    <h3>Collaborative Multiplayer</h3>
                    <p>The game supports multiplayer collaboration where players work together to transform Greenville. Unlike competitive multiplayer games, HomeSalad emphasizes cooperation, resource sharing, and collective achievement, reflecting its themes of community resilience.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Gameplay Pillars</h2>

                <div class="year-section">
